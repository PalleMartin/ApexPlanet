# Final Implementation Summary - Task-3

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented a complete User Management System with backend development and database integration using PHP and MySQL. The system includes all required features: database design, CRUD operations, authentication, security measures, and profile management.

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All requirements satisfied

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Design
- Created ER diagram with Users and Roles tables
- Implemented proper normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Defined relationships with foreign keys
- Created database schema with sample data

### 2. CRUD Operations
- **Create**: User registration and admin user creation
- **Read**: User listing table and profile display
- **Update**: Profile editing and admin user management
- **Delete**: User removal with confirmation popup

### 3. Authentication System
- Secure user registration with password hashing
- Session-based login/logout functionality
- Role-based access control (User/Admin)

### 4. Security Measures
- Prepared statements preventing SQL injection
- Server-side input validation
- Password encryption using password_hash()
- File upload validation (size, type)

### 5. Profile Management
- Edit profile page with information update
- Profile picture upload with validation
- Dynamic profile information display
