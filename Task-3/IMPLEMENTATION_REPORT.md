# Task-3 Implementation Report

## Project: User Management System with Backend Development & Database Integration

### Timeline: Days 25-36

## Overview
This report summarizes the successful implementation of the User Management System as specified in Task-3 of the ApexPlanet Full Stack Internship program. All required features have been implemented with attention to security, usability, and best practices.

## Requirements Fulfillment

### 1. Database Design ✅
- Created ER Diagram with Users and Roles tables
- Implemented normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Documented in ER_DIAGRAM.md and DATABASE_NORMALIZATION.md

### 2. CRUD Operations ✅
- **Create**: 
  - User registration form (auth/register.php)
  - Admin user creation (users/create.php)
- **Read**: 
  - User listing in HTML table format (users/read.php)
  - Profile display (users/profile.php)
- **Update**: 
  - Profile editing (users/profile.php)
  - Admin user management (users/update.php)
- **Delete**: 
  - User removal with confirmation popup (users/read.php)

### 3. Authentication System ✅
- User Registration with hashed passwords (password_hash)
- Login & Logout using Sessions
- Role-Based Login (User/Admin)

### 4. Security ✅
- Prepared Statements (mysqli_prepare) to prevent SQL Injection
- Server-side validation of all user input
- Passwords stored in encrypted format

### 5. Profile Management ✅
- Edit Profile page (users/profile.php)
- Profile picture upload with size & type validation
- Dynamic display of profile info

## Deliverables ✅
- User Management System with CRUD, authentication, and profile picture upload
- Repository with README.md and comprehensive documentation
- 8-min demo video script (VIDEO_SCRIPT.md)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Technologies
- PHP 7.4+ for server-side logic
- MySQL for database management
- Prepared statements for all database queries
- Session-based authentication

### Frontend Technologies
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 with Bootstrap 5 for styling
- JavaScript for client-side functionality
- Responsive design for all device sizes

### Security Measures
1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use prepared statements
2. **Password Security**: Passwords hashed using PHP's password_hash() function
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation for all forms
4. **File Upload Security**: Validation for file type (JPG, PNG, GIF) and size (2MB max)
5. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper authentication
6. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for Users and Admins

### Database Schema
- **Roles Table**: id, name, created_at
- **Users Table**: id, username, email, password, role_id, profile_picture, created_at, updated_at

### File Structure
The implementation follows a well-organized structure:
- `config/`: Database configuration
- `auth/`: Authentication pages
- `users/`: User management pages
- `includes/`: Header, footer, and authentication check
- `assets/`: CSS, JavaScript, and upload directories

## Key Features

### User Registration
- Form validation for all fields
- Password strength requirements (minimum 6 characters)
- Duplicate username/email checking
- Secure password hashing

### User Login/Logout
- Session-based authentication
- Role detection (User/Admin)
- Proper session destruction on logout

### Admin Functionality
- User listing with search capability
- Create, read, update, delete operations
- Role assignment during user creation
- Protection against self-deletion

### Profile Management
- Profile information editing
- Profile picture upload with preview
- File validation (type and size)
- Password change functionality

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Consistent layout across devices
- Intuitive navigation

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- All PHP files syntax-checked with no errors
- Consistent coding standards
- Proper error handling
- User-friendly error messages

### Security Testing
- SQL injection prevention verified
- Password hashing confirmed
- File upload validation tested
- Session management verified

### Functionality Testing
- All CRUD operations tested
- Authentication flow verified
- Role-based access control confirmed
- Profile management features tested
